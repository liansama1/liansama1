Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎓 I'm a microbiologist with a strong interest in **bioinformatics**, **omics data analysis**, and the integration of computational tools in biomedical research. I’m currently expanding my knowledge in:

- 🧬 Genomics and transcriptomics
- 🧪 Proteomics and metabolomics
- 🔗 Interactomics
- 📊 Data visualization and statistical modeling

- ## 🔭 I’m currently working on:

🔹 **[Intro_to_Bioinformatics](https://github.com/liansama1/Intro_to_Bioinformatics)** – An overview of what I've learned and explored in the field of bioinformatics.

🔹 **Future Projects (coming soon)**:
- Genomics workflows (variant calling, annotation)
- RNA-seq analysis (differential expression, clustering)
- Proteomics (mass spectrometry data exploration)
- Metabolomics (multivariate statistics, pathway analysis)
- Protein-protein interaction networks (STRING, Cytoscape)

- ## 🛠️ Tools & Languages:

| 🧪 Bioinformatics | 📈 Data Analysis | 💻 Programming | 🌐 Web Tools |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| BLAST, FASTQC, IGV | R (tidyverse, DESeq2, phyloseq) | Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn) | HTML, CSS, JS |
| QIIME2, Prokka | Excel, GraphPad | Bash/Shell | Git, GitHub |
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Advanced R for omics
- Machine learning applied to AMR prediction
- Workflow management (Snakemake, Nextflow)
- Data reproducibility and FAIR principles
